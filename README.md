# Scripts
Simple Python scripts that I created for personal use (but you can use it too!)

### Page Counter
This super simple script is useful to track progress while studying. Just launch it, write the number of pages you need/want to study (or use it for anything you want) and press Enter every time you make a progress.

### Study Timer
I use this to track the number of minutes (then I divide it by 60 to find out the hours) that I studied in total for some exams. It saves it in a json file stored in `~/.config/study-timer/times.json`. If you want to view it without opening it, you can launch the script and type ls to view your timers. 

## Dependencies and run
The scripts doesn't have any dependencies, you just need to install `python3` and download the repo.
To launch one of them, just type `python3 file.py` in the terminal.
